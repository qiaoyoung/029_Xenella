/**
 Asynchronously downloads an image from the specified URL request, and sets it as the image for the specified state once the request is finished. Any previous image request for the receiver will be cancelled.

 If the image is cached locally, the image is set immediately, otherwise the specified placeholder image will be set immediately, and then the remote image will be set once the request is finished.

 If a success block is specified, it is the responsibility of the block to set the image of the button before returning. If no success block is specified, the default behavior of setting the image with `setBackgroundImage:forState:` is applied.

 @param state The control state.
 @param urlRequest The URL request used for the image request.
 @param placeholderImage The background image to be set initially, until the background image request finishes. If `nil`, the button will not change its background image until the background image request finishes.
 @param success A block to be executed when the image data task finishes successfully. This block has no return value and takes three arguments: the request sent from the client, the response received from the server, and the image created from the response data of request. If the image was returned from cache, the response parameter will be `nil`.
 @param failure A block object to be executed when the image data task finishes unsuccessfully, or that finishes successfully. This block has no return value and takes three arguments: the request sent from the client, the response received from the server, and the error object describing the network or parsing error that occurred.
